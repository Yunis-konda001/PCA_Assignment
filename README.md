# Principal Component Analysis (PCA) Implementation

This project implements **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)** from scratch using **NumPy** to reduce the dimensionality of a dataset. PCA is a statistical method used to simplify complex datasets while preserving as much variance as possible. It is widely applied in areas like machine learning, data analysis, and image processing.

## Dataset
The project uses the Education in General.csv dataset, which contains features related to education indicators.
Each feature represents a measurable attribute such as literacy rates, enrollment levels, or access to educational resources, which can help analyze patterns and relationships within the education sector.

## Implementation Steps

The notebook walks through the full PCA process step by step: The project uses the Education in General.csv dataset, which contains features related to education indicators.
Each feature represents a measurable attribute such as literacy rates, enrollment levels, or access to educational resources, which can help analyze patterns and relationships within the education sector.

### 1. Load and Standardize the Data
- The dataset is loaded using `numpy.genfromtxt`.
- Each feature is standardized by subtracting the mean and dividing by the standard deviation.
- Standardization ensures all features contribute equally to the PCA, regardless of scale.

### 2. Calculate the Covariance Matrix
- The covariance matrix is computed using `numpy.cov`.
- It shows how features vary with respect to one another.

### 3. Perform Eigendecomposition
- `numpy.linalg.eig` is used to find the **eigenvalues** and **eigenvectors** of the covariance matrix.
- **Eigenvectors** represent the principal components (directions of maximum variance).
- **Eigenvalues** represent how much variance is explained by each component.

### 4. Sort Principal Components
- Eigenvectors are sorted in descending order of their eigenvalues.
- The **explained variance ratio** is calculated to show the proportion of total variance captured by each component.

### 5. Project Data onto Principal Components
- The standardized data is projected onto the top principal components (in this case, the first 4).
- This step reduces the dataset’s dimensions while retaining most of the important information.

### 6. Output the Reduced Data
- The shape of the reduced dataset confirms dimensionality reduction.
- The first few rows are displayed to preview the transformed data.

### 7. Visualize Before and After PCA
- Two scatter plots (using `matplotlib.pyplot`) visualize:
  - The original data (first two features)
  - The reduced data (first two principal components)
- This visual comparison shows how PCA simplifies data while preserving structure and variance.
